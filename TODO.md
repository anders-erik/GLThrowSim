### Before Next Stream:
- setup intuitive global/inertial coordinates system/ref. frame (right handed, z=up)
- simple vertex loader from file
- collision detection

### TODAY
- shader-program class/objects - one button UI
- dynamic simulation, not analytic form visualization


### Since last episode
- Moved from WSL to Ubuntu
	- That made the depth test work
	- window decoratations
- grayscale coloring based on clip-space z-value
